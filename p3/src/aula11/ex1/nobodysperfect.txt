Everybody makes mistakes.
Everybody has those days.
1, 2, 3, 4!

[2x]
Everybody makes mistakes.
Everybody has those days.
Everybody knows what—what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Everybody gets that way.

Sometimes I'm in a jam
I've gotta make a plan
It might be crazy
I do it anyway
No way to know for sure
I'll figure out a cure
I'm patchin' up the holes
But then it overflows

If I'm not doin' too well
Why be so hard on myself?

Nobody's perfect!
I gotta work it!
Again and again 'til I get it right
Nobody's perfect!
You live and you learn it!
And if I mess it up sometimes
Nobody's perfect

Sometimes I work a scheme
But then it flips on me
Doesn't turn out how I planned
Get stuck in quicksand
No problem can be solved
Once I get involved
I try to be delicate
Then crash right into it

But my intentions are good
Sometimes just misunderstood

Nobody's perfect!
I gotta work it!
Again and again 'til I get it right
Nobody's perfect!
You live and you learn it!
And if I mess it up sometimes

Nobody's perfect!
I gotta work it!
I know in time I'll find a way
Nobody's perfect!

Sometimes I fix things up
And they fall apart again
Nobody's perfect
I might mix things up
But I always get it right in the end
You know I do.

[Talking:]
Next time you feel like it's just one of those days when you just can't seem to win.
If things don't turn out the way you plan
Figure something else out!
Don't stay down! Try again! Yeah!

Everybody makes mistakes.
Everybody has those days.
Everybody knows what—what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Everybody gets that way

Nobody's perfect!
I gotta work it!
Again and again 'til I get it right!
Nobody's perfect!
You live and you learn it!
And if I mess it up sometimes.

Nobody's perfect!
I gotta work it!
I know in time I'll find a way
Nobody's perfect.
You live and you learn it!
'Cause everybody makes mistakes
Nobody's perfect!

Nobody's perfect!
No, no!
Nobody's perfect!
